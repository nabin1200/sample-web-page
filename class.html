            <h3>Dr. Sanduk Ruit</h3>
            <p>Dr. Ruit is the co-founder of the Himalayan Cataract Project, and has made it his life’s mission to give people their eyesight 
                back, regardless of whether they can afford to pay for the treatment. Born in remote eastern Nepal, family tragedy led him 
                to train as a doctor, eventually specialising in ophthalmology and studying in Australia. He became a highly skilled surgeon 
                and, on his return to Nepal, he set about finding a way to perform high-level eye operations at low-level costs, and without 
                the need for an established urban hospital. For almost 20 years, Dr. Ruit had been working at his Tilgaga Eye Centre and giving
                 the gift of sight to people from remote parts of Nepal and across the Himalayas, often working without charge. It is estimated 
                 that he has restored sight for over 130,000 people across Asia and Africa to date.
